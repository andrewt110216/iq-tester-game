# Demos

## Gameplay

*A simple (albeit not very successful!) game looks like this.*

*As the game begins, focus on the bottom of the screen to see the current board.*

## Feature: Undo a Jump (Go Back)

*If you make a mistake, or see a better move, use a period to undo your last move!*

## Multiple Pegs to Jump

*If you pick a peg that has multiple potential jumps, the possibilities will be highlighted.*

*Choose the peg you'd like to jump over!*

## Need a Challenge?!

*Maybe you're a **GENIUS** and `iqtester` tells you so over and over again. Kind of like me (I mean look at that score).*

*Once you get over the flattery and are ready to be challenged again, you can make the board size larger.*

*That ought to keep you entertained long enough!*
